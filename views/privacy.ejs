      <p>The mobile application collects fine precision geolocation (GPS) data of the user's movements. This data is shared to other people only if the user decides so. Geolocation data is generally considered sensitive because it can reveal user's whereabouts and, if stored, the history of their travels.</p>

      <p>In addition to geolocation data, application collects photos taken and text written by the user in the application that are part of the route tasks. It also collects user feedback. All this data is shared to other people only if the user decides so.

      <p>The collected data can be used for research purposes.</p>
